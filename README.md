# OCD Patient Analysis - Data Science Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data related to OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) patients, performing detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and implementing machine learning models to classify and predict patient conditions. The goal is to derive meaningful insights from the dataset and evaluate model performance using various metrics.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Data visualization and statistical analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: AdaBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy score, skewness, kurtosis, and other evaluation metrics.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab


## Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Encoded categorical variables.
- Normalized and scaled numerical features.

## Machine Learning Models Implemented
1. **Decision Tree**: Used for classification with interpretability.
2. **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning technique to improve accuracy.
3. **AdaBoost**: Boosting algorithm that improves weak learners.

## Model Evaluation
- **Accuracy Score**: Measures the correctness of predictions.
- **Skewness & Kurtosis**: Analyzes the distribution of the dataset.


## Results
- Identified significant features affecting OCD diagnosis.
- Compared model performances to select the most effective approach.
- Provided insights into data patterns and distributions.
