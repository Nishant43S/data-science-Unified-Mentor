# OCD Patient Analysis - Data Science Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data related to OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) patients, performing detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and implementing machine learning models to classify and predict patient conditions. The goal is to derive meaningful insights from the dataset and evaluate model performance using various metrics.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Data visualization and statistical analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: AdaBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy score, skewness, kurtosis, and other evaluation metrics.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab


## Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Encoded categorical variables.
- Normalized and scaled numerical features.

## Machine Learning Models Implemented
1. **Decision Tree**: Used for classification with interpretability.
2. **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning technique to improve accuracy.
3. **AdaBoost**: Boosting algorithm that improves weak learners.

## Model Evaluation
- **Accuracy Score**: Measures the correctness of predictions.
- **Skewness & Kurtosis**: Analyzes the distribution of the dataset.


## Results
- Identified significant features affecting OCD diagnosis.
- Compared model performances to select the most effective approach.
- Provided insights into data patterns and distributions.


# Netflix Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Netflix’s dataset to uncover insights related to content distribution, trends, and audience preferences. Using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy)**, we analyzed Netflix’s content catalog to understand patterns in **content types, country-wise production, release trends, and popular genres**.

## Key Insights

- **Netflix has more movies than TV shows**, with movies comprising ~70% of total content.

### 2. Content Ratings
- **TV-MA is the most common rating**, indicating a focus on mature audience content.

### 3. Country-Wise Production
- **The US leads in content production, followed by India.**

### 4. Peak Release Year
- **2019 had the highest number of content releases**, with a decline in 2020–2021 due to the pandemic.

### 5. Popular Genres
- **International movies and dramas dominate**, with romance, thrillers, and holiday-themed movies being common.

### 6. Monthly Release Trends
- **More movies are released monthly compared to TV shows.**

### 7. Director Insights
- **Rajiv Chilaka is the most featured director on Netflix.**

### 8. Popular Themes
- Keywords like **“Love,” “Movie,” and “Christmas”** appear frequently, indicating a focus on romance and holiday themes.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for data analysis
- **Data Cleaning, Visualization, Feature Extraction**


## Conclusion
This analysis highlights **Netflix’s preference for movies over TV shows, its global content strategy, and its focus on mature audience content**. Using **data science and visualization techniques**, we derived key insights to understand Netflix’s content trends effectively.
